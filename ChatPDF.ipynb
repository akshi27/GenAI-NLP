The system leverages PyMuPDF for document loading, HuggingFace embeddings, Recursive Character TextSplitter for text chunking, Chroma for vector storage, and HuggingFaceHub for large language model integration. Users can query the document for summaries, explanations, and more, facilitating advanced document interaction and understanding.\n",
